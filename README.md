# Getting Started with Create React App

## Started learning React

In the project directory,
- I've changed some lines of official basic react app.
- learned to deploy it.
I know it sounds awkward that instead of learning and building more why I've deployed the some line changes.


### Answer is,

I'm facing some abnormal situation so getting enough motivation for learning the react will be fetched from here. As I'm facing some absence system requirements and resources.

### Test the scratch project

Deployment : [deployed](https://Mr-vabs.github.io/todo-list/)
